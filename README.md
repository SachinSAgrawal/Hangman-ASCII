# Hangman

## About
Play the classic game of Hangman by guessing a secret word before the stick figure is hung! This Python implementation includes ASCII art visuals to represent the figure and post for incorrect guesses. The words are taken from a list of the 10,000 most common in the English language that longer than 4 letters. If you like this game, I would appreciate if you starred it or even shared it with your friends.

## Instructions
* You will be presented with a series of dashes representing the letters of a secret word.
* Guess letters by inputting them one at a time.
* If the letter is in the secret word, the corresponding dashes will be replaced with that letter.
* If the letter is not in the secret word, a part of the figure will be drawn.
* You have 8 incorrect guesses before the figure is fully drawn and the game ends.
* Try to guess the word before the hangman is completed to win!

## Installation
I would recommend running this on [Replit](https://replit.com/), as that is how I have been doing it. Just copy and paste the [mainCode.py](mainCode.py) and [wordList.txt](wordList.txt) files into a new project and hit run! You can also clone this repository and run it through terminal on a device with python installed.
